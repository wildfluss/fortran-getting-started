# 

get fortls first

```bash
brew install fortls
```

then, get VS Code INSIDERS and install "Modern Fortran" extension

get fpm here https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html like this

```bash
brew tap fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran
brew install fpm
```

then use this example code https://github.com/jchristopherson/linalg , first clone that example like this 

```bash
cd path-to-here
git clone git@github.com:jchristopherson/linalg.git ../linalg
cd ../linalg
fpm build
```

then figure out where build went 

```bash
cd path-to-here
find ../linalg/build/ -name linalg.mod
```

would output 

```bash
../linalg/build//gfortran_F628532E9DD279D9/linalg.mod
```

XXX change `.vscode/settings.json` settings `fortran.linter.includePaths` to `gfortran_F628532E9DD279D9` above accordingly 

aand also change path in `fortran.linter.extraArgs` to 

```bash
$ find ../linalg/build/ -name liblinalg.a
../linalg/build//gfortran_F6DF39280A7CA76F/linalg/liblinalg.a
```
